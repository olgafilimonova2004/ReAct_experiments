Claim: CHiPs is based on a TV episode written by Rick Rosner.
Thought 1: Thought 1: I need to search for information about the TV show CHiPs and its origins to determine if it is based on a TV episode written by Rick Rosner.
Action 1: Search[CHiPs origin]
Observation 1: CHiPs is an American police procedural television series that aired from 1977 to 1983. The show follows the adventures of two Los Angeles County Highway Patrol officers, Officer Adam-12, played by Robert Stack and Martin Milner. The series was created by Steven Bochco and Mark L. Lester, and it was inspired by the real-life work of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Traffic Division. There is no mention of it being based on a specific TV episode written by Rick Rosner.
Thought 2: Since there is no information linking CHiPs to a TV episode written by Rick Rosner, the claim seems to be false.

Observation 1: Permafrost, which is soil or rock that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, plays a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle. As global temperatures rise due to climate change, permafrost begins to thaw, releasing stored carbon in the form of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This process can further contribute to global warming, creating a feedback loop.

Thought 2: The observation indicates that as permafrost thaws due to rising global temperatures, it releases stored carbon, which can increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thereby exacerbating global warming.
